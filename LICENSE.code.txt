   Changes made by Jonathan Cranford:
       In the "complete" directory:
         * Added swagger and springfox
         * Changed GreetingController to only respond to GET
         * Tweaked GreetingController and GreetingControllerTests to facilitate testing retry logic

       The "client" directory was generated by swagger-codegen with the
       following command-line:
           $ swagger-codegen generate -i http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs -l java --library resttemplate -o client --api-package hello.client.api --model-package hello.client.model --additional-properties invokerPackage=hello.client,dateLibrary=java8 --group-id org.springframework --artifact-id gs-rest-service-client

       The "client-cli-retry" directory contains experiments with spring-retry.
